Respected Profesor,

I am a student of Masters in Computer Science Part Time , first year. I want to do my specialization in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. I am deeply interested in the subject and would like to study it in depth. I'm especially interested in exploring emergeing mediums like Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Multimodal Interfaces.

The specific area of reserach that I want to pursue for my Masters degree is : Interaction Design for Virtual Reality. Though Virtual Reality has existed since the ninties, the technology has advanced considerably in the last few years and is in the verge of becoming mainstream. I believe that beyond gaming Virtual Reality has the potential of being a viable mdedium for storytelling and education. From a design perspective Virtual Reality as a medium affords exciting oppertunities as well as significant challenges. For example, implementation of an intuitive and efficient menu system poses complexities far beyond those encountered in design of screen based menus. Not only display medium; advances in binaural audio and multimodal interfaces opens up tantalizing possibilites for new forms of user interaction. 

Though I have very basic ideas regrading my desired research topic; it would be very helpful if I can discuss this with you furhter. Also I will be greatly oblidged if you can please advise me on the process of finalizing my area of specialization and of finding a research topic. I'd be happy to meet you in person. 





Regarding my topic for Masters Thesis I would like to
