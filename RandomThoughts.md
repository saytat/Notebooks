+ Notice the connection between overworked neo-liberal middle class and over-consuming middle class. India, US, Poland.

+ The opressed of the world form one community (borrowed from Polish 19th century **Marxist** opposed to Polish nationalism, he wrote "proleteriat" in place of "opressed"), the just of the world form one community. All differences of nationality, ethnicity, language and culture, religion are minisule compared with what is common. As Berger said "what we have in common is bigger than what sets us apart".

+ Correction to above: The opressed and the just form one community. The just is firstly an opressed, since s/he is opressed by being just in an un-just system. But is the opressed also just? (thought on reading Ivan Illich's speech "The Educational enterprise in the Light of the Gospel")

+ "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" Matthew, 7,7

+ More seriously, the point is that in capitalist societies the market permanently limits the scope for democratic political intervention. The same is true in technology. A society whose economy is based on the pursuit of private profit is doomed to make a suboptimal use of many technologies. It is a dilemma that has deepened in social media.

+ Photo idea: after watching Tiane Doan na Champasaak's photos of Kolkata (http://collectordaily.com/tiane-doan-na-champassak-kolkata/): Photos of - i. Middle calss life, ii. Lower class life, iii. Outdated professions, trades, crafts being created. Mix i and ii.

+ From letter to myself. Origin date: Sept-16,2014: (1. Bind myself to technology, become a techno-worker. Primarily software, alternatively hardware, even agriculture.

2. The world has to be changed, but the change won't be done in my lifetime, not even in one village perhaps, but it will. Faith in an unbound future.

3. The techno-managerial skills of capitalist economy can't be just thrown out of the window. (Didn't russian revolution demonstrate that peril?) not only because they can be effective, but also because they are not purely capitalist, put in other words not purely individual profit maximization, capitalism taps into vital social forces, into intercommunication, into sociality. The tools - some tools - reflect that. 
The point is to learn today for a just fight tomorrow.

4. There is no truth that is not to be found in distractions. There is no truth independent of the regular distraction prone life. "Know Thyself" the command stands. Stop bulshitting yourself. Even when mimicking other life forms, not lose sight of the basics.  

5. Make a plan for regular life, keep on revising it, but make a plan.)
