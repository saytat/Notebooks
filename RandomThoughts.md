+ The opressed of the world form one community (borrowed from Polish 19th century **Marxist** opposed to Polish nationalism, he wrote "proleteriat" in place of "opressed"), the just of the world form one community. All differences of nationality, ethnicity, language and culture, religion are minisule compared with what is common. As Berger said "what we have in common is bigger than what sets us apart".

+ Correction to above: The opressed and the just form one community. The just is firstly an opressed, since s/he is opressed by being just in an un-just system. But is the opressed also just? (thought on reading Ivan Illich's speech "The Educational enterprise in the Light of the Gospel")

+ "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you" Matthew, 7,7

+ More seriously, the point is that in capitalist societies the market permanently limits the scope for democratic political intervention. The same is true in technology. A society whose economy is based on the pursuit of private profit is doomed to make a suboptimal use of many technologies. It is a dilemma that has deepened in social media.
