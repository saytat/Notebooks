+ Notice the connection between overworked neo-liberal middle class and over-consuming middle class. India, US, Poland.

+ The opressed of the world form one community (borrowed from Polish 19th century **Marxist** opposed to Polish nationalism, he wrote "proleteriat" in place of "opressed"), the just of the world form one community. All differences of nationality, ethnicity, language and culture, religion are minisule compared with what is common. As Berger said "what we have in common is bigger than what sets us apart".

+ Correction to above: The opressed and the just form one community. The just is firstly an opressed, since s/he is opressed by being just in an un-just system. But is the opressed also just? (thought on reading Ivan Illich's speech "The Educational enterprise in the Light of the Gospel")
