## Notes on Photography

[Hands, in fact, figure in these books as eloquently as faces.](http://www.americansuburbx.com/2010/10/review-paul-graham-shimmer-of.html)

down every beach the long day ends

I couldn't shake the sea noise out of my head.

Three years ago I stopped trying to be a writer and started photographing.
The photographs here present what went on in a beach one spring day. In a sense so many photographs start by saying 'On that day...'. These photos are no different.
For some weeks I have been poring over these images on my laptop screen; shuffling them, touching and retouching parts, trying to conjure the hue of light that evening. And I realize - that day at the beach, I have no way of writing about it. I can't even weave together a narrative of events in my mind. The images are the memories I don't have. They lead me towards a zone in wihch there is flow of time, but the movement is not linear; there are events but nothing eventful happens.



I realized only now that this series of photographs echoe in some roundabout way a short video - "One day at the tajpoor beach" made by my brother some years back. The video has some footage of my younger self - from days when I still looked at the world as a text to be read and written about.

 Some photograps - most natably of Henri Cartier Bresson - gives the aura of eventfullness to an otherwise mundane moment. You turn a page, the next image, another decisive moment. A series of decisive moments. But the dypthics seek to invoke what passes between such moments. By putting two discreet images together maybe the in-betweeness of such moments can be invoked?    

"I became a photographer because photographers did have to be wherever they wanted to take pictures, or at least their cameras did. And because there was some connection, inherent in the nature of the medium, between that place and its picture. And the viewers, despite any pitfalls or roadblocks put in their way, could still to some extent be there too. This has always struck me as somewhat amazing: That magic little box enables one to leave, in a small way and for a short while, one’s own time and space and to occupy, maybe only superficially, another time and space: a then and there that really existed as well as a here and now. Photographs are both real images and imaged realities. This is both unique among media and new in human experience."

"Photography is not art because the basic impulse of the photographer is diametrically opposed to the basic impulse of the artist at least in one large respect. The artist tries to bring into existence something new that never had concrete existence before. The photographer tries to bring into existence something new that preserves something that already has concrete existence but will cease to exist in just that way in the next moment or day or year. And for Goethe, at least, the imagination for the real was imagination’s highest form. Perhaps photography is simply a higher stage in humanity’s artistic evolution from that first hand-drawn, cave-hidden deer. And critics are known to be dinosaurs."

As Mr. Harbutt moved from photojournalism to pursuing more personal work, he also influenced Alex Webb, who attended a workshop with him as a 20-year-old student.

“He believed that photography was a unique visual language that cannot be expressed in words,” Mr. Webb said. “As a matter of fact, if it could be expressed in words, then it wouldn’t be worth doing.”

Nevertheless, Mr. Harbutt wrote about photography with great insight, as embodied in the afterword of the 1974 book “Travelog.” It is titled “I Don’t Take Pictures, Pictures Take Me.”http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/charles-harbutt-photography-as-a-reality-high/?_r=1
