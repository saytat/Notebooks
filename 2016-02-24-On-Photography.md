## Notes on Photography

[Hands, in fact, figure in these books as eloquently as faces.](http://www.americansuburbx.com/2010/10/review-paul-graham-shimmer-of.html)

Four years ago I stopped trying to be a writer and started to photograph. I'm paraphrasing Charles Harbutt (Fifteen years ago, I stopped being a writer and became a photographer.) but only becuase its the truth. 
The photographs here present what went on in the beach, what goes on there, perhaps not every day but every once in a while. In a sense so many photographs start by saying 'On that day...'. These photos are no different.

I realized only now that this series of photographs echoe in some roundabout way a short video - "One day at the tajpoor beach" made by my brother some years back.
