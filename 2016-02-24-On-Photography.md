## Notes on Photography

[Hands, in fact, figure in these books as eloquently as faces.](http://www.americansuburbx.com/2010/10/review-paul-graham-shimmer-of.html)

Three years ago I stopped trying to be a writer and started to photograph. (I'm paraphrasing Charles Harbutt (Fifteen years ago, I stopped being a writer and became a photographer.) but only becuase its the truth. )
The photographs here present what went on in the beach, what goes on there, perhaps not every day but every once in a while. In a sense so many photographs start by saying 'On that day...'. These photos are no different. All photos are of dead time. Of the past. All photos are of nostalgia. But they ever

I realized only now that this series of photographs echoe in some roundabout way a short video - "One day at the tajpoor beach" made by my brother some years back. The video has some footage of my younger self - from days when I still looked at the world as a text to be read and written about.

I have been poring over these images on my laptop screen for some weeks now, shuffling them, touching and retouching parts, trying to conjure the hue of sunlight that evening. And I realize - that day at the beach, I have no way of writing about it. I can't even stitch together a narrative of events in my mind. For some reason unknown to me, the photographs come together. These images of a place at a 

"I became a photographer because photographers did have to be wherever they wanted to take pictures, or at least their cameras did. And because there was some connection, inherent in the nature of the medium, between that place and its picture. And the viewers, despite any pitfalls or roadblocks put in their way, could still to some extent be there too. This has always struck me as somewhat amazing: That magic little box enables one to leave, in a small way and for a short while, one’s own time and space and to occupy, maybe only superficially, another time and space: a then and there that really existed as well as a here and now. Photographs are both real images and imaged realities. This is both unique among media and new in human experience."

"Photography is not art because the basic impulse of the photographer is diametrically opposed to the basic impulse of the artist at least in one large respect. The artist tries to bring into existence something new that never had concrete existence before. The photographer tries to bring into existence something new that preserves something that already has concrete existence but will cease to exist in just that way in the next moment or day or year. And for Goethe, at least, the imagination for the real was imagination’s highest form. Perhaps photography is simply a higher stage in humanity’s artistic evolution from that first hand-drawn, cave-hidden deer. And critics are known to be dinosaurs."

As Mr. Harbutt moved from photojournalism to pursuing more personal work, he also influenced Alex Webb, who attended a workshop with him as a 20-year-old student.

“He believed that photography was a unique visual language that cannot be expressed in words,” Mr. Webb said. “As a matter of fact, if it could be expressed in words, then it wouldn’t be worth doing.”

Nevertheless, Mr. Harbutt wrote about photography with great insight, as embodied in the afterword of the 1974 book “Travelog.” It is titled “I Don’t Take Pictures, Pictures Take Me.”http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/charles-harbutt-photography-as-a-reality-high/?_r=1
