#Thoughts on Google Cardboard's capabilities as of May-2016#

..* Cardboard app has a new hack for navigating back: turn the cardboard at 90 degrees to the viewing plane. Not the most elegant hack for sure, but one that works, adding the ability to navigate back.
..* The artic exploration hack is a good guide to what is possible at this early stage in terms of navigation and exploration inside a VR environment. Examples - the "learn" part - where its possible to open a post it/ card like window (it looks like a painting/photo hung inside the 3D environment). Placing 2D interface in a dynamic 3D environment creates a new experience of viewing that hadn't been achieved earlier in the history of Graphical User Interface. This is primarily because the 3D environment is 3D for the first time in history of (widely available) digital screens. The "learn" segment demonstrates the vast possibilites of creating educational content inside a virtual world.
..* Till now I had watched mostly videos in Cardboard. But 3D animated environments - actual Virtual Reality - has alreay made more advanced interactions possible. Videos/VR Films are still basically non-interactive. The narrative is pre-programmed
