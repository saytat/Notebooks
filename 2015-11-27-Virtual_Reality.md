## A New Post

Jaron Lanier:
The first thing I’ll say is I use VR a lot these days in research of different kinds — cognitive science research and some visualization stuff. I also love working with exotic optics and sensors and I still play around with that stuff. And I absolutely take time to play beyond what’s needed for the research. I still find great pleasure in screwing around with it. But I’ve always felt, from the very beginning that it’s — how would I say it — you know, every musician I know prefers to live without the radio on, enjoys the silence and contrast. The best way to use VR, not in some moralistic or judgmental sense, but just in terms of my experience, is [to] use it as little as possible and enjoy the contrast that it gives me to reality.

At the old lab, VPL, one of the things we’d sometimes have is just a flower sitting there. So if somebody was in a demo for 20 minutes, we’d come out and say, just look at this flower. And you suddenly saw this flower in this hyperreal way because your senses had adjusted to this sort of lower resolution of a virtual world. Then, when you see reality, you suddenly see it with this kind of detail and this density. You see just the sheer reality of it. You just feel things from it. It’s really incredible. To me, that contrast, that feeling that you have when you’re out of it after you’ve used it, has universally been more precious than what happens in it. So, yeah, I like it. I might be wrong about this, but I suspect that a lot of people will find what I found: that the coolest thing to do with [VR] is not to be in there for hours the way people are with their pocket devices these days, just staring at the screen…

Thought Vectors:
+ Can VR deliver a less distracting medium for reading or learning? The hyperlink medium is highly distractive, disruppting older reading habits. Can VR provide a more immersive, less distractive environment? Just think, even podcasts provide more immersive experience than the hyperlink text/search based information capture.

+ Not VR, this. Is there a social media that is voice based, aural, not visual, and not only for the blind?

+ Marshall McLuhall writes in his essay "Challenges..." that artists are the only ones who are capable of engaging and negotiating with new technologies; they are capable because they are the only ones who are fully sensient to the present.

+ I strongly fed the need for greater complexity in print/web media coverage of Paris attacks. If instead of instant opinion pieces (from various political spectrum) masquerading as journalism there would be more insightful, multi-perspective, persuasive (not propagandist) and most importantly slow content created.

+ Exactly. In times of opinion pieces masquerading as analysis; propaganda as news and analysis getting more and more entrenched in partisanship; what we urgently need is “content” (in lieu of a better word) that is more multi-perspective, complex and actually provokes thinking not news consumption. The best analysis or written essays have been producing this effect for centuries; but perhaps the interactive medium can also be designed in ways that will facilitate such engagement.

+ Trying to mimic the acceleration of our world with frantic content publishing will not participate in people making sense of our reality or feeling more empathetical towards one another. This is where interactivity can make a difference. By showing us the intricate mechanics of the world, by giving people the power of choice, interactive storytellers produce experiences that are more demanding but also more rewarding than a thousand articles.
Choice is not a good word. Or put differently, choice is not nearly enough. What choice should lead to is analysis from multiple perspectives. If the choice of following multiple persopectives is inbuilt into the medium, then the experiencer needs to explore the multiplicity. As an aside, we live in a world whre there are multiplicity of everything; however only part - a very small part form an actual multiplicity; most multiplicities are a surface effect - but that does not mean they are any less real; or that they lead to any less real consequences.
