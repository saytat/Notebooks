## A New Post


Hello,

I am a student at PJWSTK -  Masters in Computer Science - weekend study, first year. I want to pursue specialization in the field of Human-Computer Interaction Design. I'm especially interested in emerging mediums like Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Though I come from an Engineering background and have worked for some years as Business Analyst responsible for preparing interfaces, my interest in Interaction Design is both research oriented and creative. Since I'm passionate about photography and photography aparatus, both analog and digital, I have a strong interest in visual design and visual storytelling.

Though I have some basic ideas regrading my desired research topic; it would be very helpful if I can discuss them with you further. Also I will be greatly obliged if you can please advise me on the process of finalizing my area of specialization as Multimedia/Human Computer Interaction and of finding a research topic. I'd be happy to meet you in person. Please let me a convenient time to meet.


Thank You,

Sayam Ghosh
