Dear Sir,

I want to pursue Master of Science in Informatics course (part-time) in your instituion with specialization - Human Computer Interaction. I have gone through the information present in the website but still have some questions regarding my eligibility for the course and the admission criteria. I would be greatful if you can address some of my questions. I'm providing some background information about myself that may help you judge my position:

+ I'm an Indian citizen currently working in Warsaw (having valid work permit and temporary resident card). I work for a Global Software Consultancy company. My role is Business Systems Analyst.
+ I have Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electrical Engineering from Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India. I completed 4 years - 8 semesters - of study in 2007.
+ Having 7+ years of experience in Global IT company, I'm proficient in Software Engineering concepts, Testing Methodologies - Manual as well as Automation, Business Analysis skills from Prototyping, Requirement Analysis to User Research. I have working knowledge of Databases and SQL. My programming skill is basic (having taken introductory courses in University and Job internship). 
+ Other than the above I have working knowledge of HTML, CSS and Image processing softwares, specifically Photoshop. 
+ I'm in the process of completing A2 Level Polish. My target is to complete B1 by August and B2 level by end of this year. 
+ I'm deeply interested in gaining formal training in Human Computer Interaction with a goal of pursuing doctoral studies in future.

Questions that I have:

1. Bearing my eductional background and work experience please confirm that I am eligible to be considered as a candidate for this year's Masters In Computer Science course with Human Computer Interaction specialization. 
2. I understand that the classes will be conducted in Polish. I strongly believe that by September this year I would reach enough proficiency to attend Polish only classes. However, is there any formal criteria in terms of proficiency in language - A2, B1, B2 that is mandatory for admission? Please let me know.
3. Since the admission process will start in May, I might not be enough proficient in this time for an interview wholely in Polish. In that case will my lack of proficiency hamper my chance of getting admitted?
4. Will completing Masters course successfully enable me to pursue doctoral research in your institution?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 


Thanks in advance,

Sayam Ghosh
