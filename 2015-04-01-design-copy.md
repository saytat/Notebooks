## web card - idea sketch

**Core Idea**
Life as travel, even when not travelling. Birthday as a train station (not airport - they are heidius) to alight on, not a temporary destination, but the station to step into another place. (it can also be the station you missed by sleeping through the night).

**Elements**
+	Train and cycle as metaphors.
+	Poems and rhymes as quotations. (Look up that fb page with polish quotes). Use Szymborszka

**Design Notes**
+	Mostly animated, with geometric shapes as animated elements.
+	At least one gif - of P building sand castle.
