## Project Ideas

## City Exploration - Geolocation - Maps - apps - Data Visualization:
Questions: There are a host of apps for mapping/exploring city space. What's going on for non urban spaces?? 
Update: there are lots of services for Data Visualization, Information storage for environment, social sector data, stories. Check out http://www.vizzuality.com/

Idea#1: Storify Krochmalna Street. A guided tour. The app is a slick walking tour service with primarily audio. Some images and videos - perhaps. Äny User can create content. But so can "experts". There is no hierarchy or boundary between professionals (historians, literature students, critics, voice actors) and ametures. But there can be degress of visibility etc to upvote more useful tours. The content can include the following:
1. Read out from books describing Krochmalna. A crowdsourced audio collage. Ametures and professionals can participate.
2. Photographs. Both of "historical" interest. But also of daily life in the street. The goal is not to create only continuity in story (like illustrating the text with the photographs. But also to highlight the differences and open up different viewpoints on the space. 
Three levels: i. Photos illustrating a time based narrative. Like life in Krochmalna in between war years.
ii. Photos illustrating subsequent lifes, lifes that are perhaps not so well documented in language. 
iii. The third level is what Berger describes in Another Way of Telling. How does the image and text live in conjuction? Also Teju Cole's Instagram feed.
3. Get content from web. The received content can be used to craft a story. The primary use case of the app is crafting digital stories. Location based, geotagged.
4. 


User Interface:
The app should be able to search for content available in net automatically. In order to capture content, it has to go beyond its own content upload/create UI. For example, if someone uploads a twitter story with hashtag #krochmalna; that input could be used to pull the information into the app. From instagram as well???
The pulled in content can be kept in a POOL for curators to use to tell a story. Crafting the story is paramount.  



Examples:
1. New York Public Library created an app for mapping on top of old printed maps digitized. Citizen cartography: http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/footprint
2. Citizen ecology: A map of forestation/deforestation with stories: http://www.globalforestwatch.org/
3. Similar but more ambitiousŁ http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/resource-watch
4. **This connects with citizen science:** http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/old-weather
5. **This app already promises to do what I was thinking of as a city exploration idea:** http://deriveapp.com/s/v2/about/
6. **Write emails to trees:** http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/when-you-give-a-tree-an-email-address/398210/

## Education technology:

Examples:
1. Indian startup : https://www.techinasia.com/india-edsix-briain-lab-funding


Random Notes:
1. BikeCity is alrady a kind of augmented perception app. I can create a bike trip and share it with you. Does it allow story pinning? 

2. The internet as a time travel machine. The videos, images, texts, even layout of web as the material for experiencing/constructing a history. Here is the pull of her-story. When I'm playing it I'm trying to piece together the story from the fragments. This is the backbone of research. Of looking for useful pieces of information - fitting together the puzzle - creating a a coherent narrative. Repeat.
2. ["Like Ingrees today, the world will become the reference grid for video games. For example you will be able to challenge any athletes around the world on a 100m race on your usual running track, or even stroll through the streets of Paris in the 18th century to solve investigations and why not escape from a zombie invasion in a park."](https://medium.com/ui-collection/the-future-of-augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-alternative-reality-83539b85b086#.z89g1zsjm)
3. [As part of mmorpgs, we will superimpose this virtual world on our physical environment, in order to evolve in it. In this world, we will have to face real challenges. Imagine yourself trying to find the spear of Odin while physically confronting the far North and actually braving the tumult of a stormy sea to reach the island Vulcano in Italy to gain Ifrit’s ultimate fire incantation. Depending on the game selected, the architecture of your city will be substituted in your view by, for example steampunk buildings or elven shops. Players will put on their avatars like a costume and only subscribers will be able to see it.](https://medium.com/ui-collection/the-future-of-augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-alternative-reality-83539b85b086#.z89g1zsjm)
