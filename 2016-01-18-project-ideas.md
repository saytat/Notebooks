## Project Ideas

## City Exploration - Geolocation - Maps - apps - Data Visualization:
Questions: There are a host of apps for mapping/exploring city space. What's going on for non urban spaces?? 
Update: there are lots of services for Data Visualization, Information storage for environment, social sector data, stories. Check out http://www.vizzuality.com/

Idea#1: Storify Krochmalna Street. A guided tour. The app is a slick walking tour service with primarily audio. Some images and videos - perhaps. Äny User can create content. But so can "experts". There is no hierarchy or boundary between professionals (historians, literature students, critics, voice actors) and ametures. But there can be degress of visibility etc to upvote more useful tours. The content can include the following:
1. Read out from books describing Krochmalna. A crowdsourced audio collage. Ametures and professionals can participate.
2. Photographs. Both of "historical" interest. But also of daily life in the street. The goal is not to create only continuity in story (like illustrating the text with the photographs. But also to highlight the differences and open up different viewpoints on the space. 
Three levels: i. Photos illustrating a time based narrative. Like life in Krochmalna in between war years.
ii. Photos illustrating subsequent lifes, lifes that are perhaps not so well documented in language. 
iii. The third level is what Berger describes in Another Way of Telling. How does the image and text live in conjuction? Also Teju Cole's Instagram feed.
3. Get content from web. The received content can be used to craft a story. The primary use case of the app is crafting digital stories. Location based, geotagged.
4. The audience can become part of the story by recording something or by uploading something. A Krochmalna street in 365 days project kind of thing.
5. This app can be a limited time app. Like tie it with an event like Singer's Warsaw. Or Prus's Lalka walk. 
6. It can be ited to already existing forms of book themed literary walks. School children in Warsaw alrady go for Lalka walks. How can this platform tie in with an existing activity. 
7. Potential use case: B is on a Lalka walk. She listens to a passage in Lazieki Park. The passage gives rise to a desire to comment. Or even tell her own story. She records it at the place. The content becomes geo-tagged. Only available in the location. Use a tree in Lazieki (add an iBeacon) to replay the story next time someone comes along.
8. The app catalogs stories (not random content). The stories get upvoted, downvoted. Enhanced. 
9. Add illustrations, gifs, other artworks.
10. Through geolocation the app becomes space bound. Stories get activated only when the user is there.
11. Can the app become time bound also? Creating anticipation??
12. Allowing extension of the story. Extension of Lalka. Where Wlokuski talks to himself. Or Rzeki wtites a new diary entry that did not exist in the book. Extending the book.
13. Historic Maps. Maybe add a mapp coluring (via third party) plugin.
14. Can this app include google cardboard apps?
15. This can potentially extend beyond the city. Part of a bike trip for example. Audio guided bike trip.
16. In connection with 3D sound. The platform being used for curating a sonic event in a place. For example, there are summer concerts in Lazieki. The concerts can be recorded in 3D and geotagged. Later, say in summer, the visitor to the park can revisit the ausio sundscapes through the app. Not only Lazieki concerts, but also natural sounds. Of birds, maybe animals?? Similarly for Vistula walk. Here, ambinet music comes to the fore.
17. Connection with rehabilation of Parkinson's disease patient: 
"13.20 Justyna Maculewicz – Rhytmic walking interactions with auditory feedback
18. Walking in forest or parks. A soundscape can be produced and geotagged. So Walker 1 creates a soundscape / soundmap and uploads it. When Walker 2 retraces the path - the soundscape becomes audible.
19. Geolocation based conversation. Use Case: Participant A is in Lazieki. Reaches a bench when the app signals that a connection to Kolkata is availble. If the user agrees to connect, she is connected to Participant B in Dhakuriya Lake Kolkata sitting on a bench. They can talk in real time. Or text. Or the texts can be voice synthesized. The two benches mark portals that can be connected.
20. Augmented Reality - visual and aural pinned to printed posters. Think of posters of music festival that can activate soundscapes by image recognition. https://www.layar.com/
21. Think about realtime audio. A personal radio feed.
22. Beacons and other NFC tech for creating locative media inside built area like prison (auswitz), castle, shipyard (Gdank) - performance pieces in time bound guided tour. Or sound installations - telling narrative.
23. Locative media game being played in Bieszczady or Tatry. The story puzzle unlocked in situ.
24. One of the most urgent "app" for this platform can be locative media documentary. Like a queue of the places where accidents happened. Like here in Poland people put up memorials in street corners where people died.


Walking is an activity that plays an important part in our daily lives. In addition to
being a natural means of transportation, walking is also characterized by the
resulting sound, which can provide information about the surface, type of shoe, and
movement speed as well as the person’s age, weight, and physical condition. Until
now, few studies have shown the role of interactive auditory feedback produced by
walkers in affecting walking pace.
General goal of my research is to test rhythmic interactive walking with auditory
feedback from several perspectives. Quantitative perspective: to see how different
types of auditory cues influence tempo stability within different pace range and how
the feedback can influence preferred pace of participants. Qualitative – to see how
different feedback and cues shift perception of naturalness and perceived ease of
synchronization. I am mostly focused on ecological sounds, which are seen as the
signals, which convey richer and more useful information than just simple
metronome. There are several interesting effects emerging from my hitherto
research. When participants are asked to walk in their preferred pace and different
feedback sounds are presented, their pace also changes. Until now I have been
testing gravel and wood sound as ecological ones and a tone as a non-ecological
sound. Results show that participants have the slowest pace with gravel feedback,
then wood and a tone motivates to the fastest walking. When they are asked to
synchronize with above-mentioned sounds their results are similar with a slight worse
performance with gravel cues. Even though this feedback produces the highest
synchronizing error it is perceived as the one, which is the easiest to follow. For the
explanation to these results I am looking in neurological data. The exploratory
electroencephalographic (EEG) study was conducted to test neural activity for
interactive rhythmic walking in place with three different tempi (80, 105 and 130
BPM) in the presence of four auditory cues: two ecological (gravel, wood) and two
non – ecological (artificial aggregate, artificial solid). By analysing power spectrum
density in alpha, beta and gamma oscillations wave bands we studied brain
activations correlated with attention, motoric behaviour and semantic information
enclosed in the ecological and non – ecological auditory signals. The results revealed
the highest alpha activation for solid artificial sounds, significantly different than
gravel sound. The beta activity was the highest for both non – ecological signal, and
gamma for both aggregate sounds. We believe that our results are encouraging for
further exploration of the topic of ecological vs. non – ecological auditory cues in
rhythmic walking task, especially in a context of gait rehabilitation in Parkinson’s
disease.
Knowledge acquired through these experiments will be useful in the feedback and
cues design for gait rehabilitation (motivation, pace control, balance control,
movement continuation), exercise (motivation, perceived exertion, vigor) and
entertainment (virtual reality applications).

Justyna Maculewicz is a PhD fellow at Aalborg University Copenhagen. Her research
interests include rhythmic motoric tasks with auditory and haptic feedback.
Maculewicz received a BS in acoustics and MS in cognitive science from Adam
Mickiewicz University in Poznan. She is focused on research on ecologically valid
audio and haptic feedback and its influence on tempo-based exercise for
entertainment and rehabilitation."


##Connected idea: how about superimposing streets from different cities. i.e. make a user walk park street by walking nowy swiat? Does that make sense at all??????

Idea#1a: Storify Vistula walk. 2 banks of Vistula. Possibility to add content on more diverse topics. Like ecology, place history. The constitutive parts of the app remains the same.

User Interface:
The app should be able to search for content available in net automatically. In order to capture content, it has to go beyond its own content upload/create UI. For example, if someone uploads a twitter story with hashtag #krochmalna; that input could be used to pull the information into the app. From instagram as well???
The pulled in content can be kept in a POOL for curators to use to tell a story. Crafting the story is paramount.

Random Notes:
1. BikeCity is alrady a kind of augmented perception app. I can create a bike trip and share it with you. Does it allow story pinning? 

2. The internet as a time travel machine. The videos, images, texts, even layout of web as the material for experiencing/constructing a history. Here is the pull of her-story. When I'm playing it I'm trying to piece together the story from the fragments. This is the backbone of research. Of looking for useful pieces of information - fitting together the puzzle - creating a a coherent narrative. Repeat.
2. ["Like Ingrees today, the world will become the reference grid for video games. For example you will be able to challenge any athletes around the world on a 100m race on your usual running track, or even stroll through the streets of Paris in the 18th century to solve investigations and why not escape from a zombie invasion in a park."](https://medium.com/ui-collection/the-future-of-augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-alternative-reality-83539b85b086#.z89g1zsjm)
3. [As part of mmorpgs, we will superimpose this virtual world on our physical environment, in order to evolve in it. In this world, we will have to face real challenges. Imagine yourself trying to find the spear of Odin while physically confronting the far North and actually braving the tumult of a stormy sea to reach the island Vulcano in Italy to gain Ifrit’s ultimate fire incantation. Depending on the game selected, the architecture of your city will be substituted in your view by, for example steampunk buildings or elven shops. Players will put on their avatars like a costume and only subscribers will be able to see it.](https://medium.com/ui-collection/the-future-of-augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-alternative-reality-83539b85b086#.z89g1zsjm)

6. Detaroit, old and new photographs: http://mfadt.parsons.edu/2015/projects/oldie-but-a-new-d/


3. My topic: 3D sound applications for visually imapiered people.

1. Idea#1: 3D audio simulation of real environment for training recently blind people, children inside room/closed environment. Or for training trainers of blind people. The training can be very important for people going progressively blind. In such cases the open street can be dangerous. 3D audio simulation of open space - street can be used as training material in indoor spaces.
2. for blind children: audio based education app. teaching mathematcis via music. physics via sound interaction design.
3. Soundwalk for visually imapired people. Outdoor soundwalk. Indoor soundwalk with iBeacons technology.
4. Teaching music with haptic devices to children?
5. Sound providing information about scientific experiments? Example: geiger counter.
6. For people with low to very low eyesight, can there be any visual augmentation via google glass kind of smart eye wear? Or think of aural navigation / storytelling for low eyesight people.
