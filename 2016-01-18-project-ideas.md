## Project Ideas

## City Exploration - Geolocation - Maps - apps - Data Visualization:
Questions: There are a host of apps for mapping/exploring city space. What's going on for non urban spaces?? 
Update: there are lots of services for Data Visualization, Information storage for environment, social sector data, stories. Check out http://www.vizzuality.com/

Examples:
1. New York Public Library created an app for mapping on top of old printed maps digitized. Citizen cartography: http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/footprint
2. Citizen ecology: A map of forestation/deforestation with stories: http://www.globalforestwatch.org/
3. Similar but more ambitious≈Å http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/resource-watch
4. **This connects with citizen science:** http://www.vizzuality.com/projects/old-weather
5. **This app already promises to do what I was thinking of as a city exploration idea:** http://deriveapp.com/s/v2/
