2006, 
"Having toured the world over, Sigur Ros returned home to play a series of free, unannounced concerts in Iceland." Heima in Icelandic means "at home". 
Being grounded in Warsaw I put on Heima one freezing January evening. A boundless landscape held within seventeen inch. The layered music spill over from closed back headphones. Presence takes gentle effort. When it takes place, the window vanishes. Being transported. Yes, that's what happens at those odd moments. Until it ends. "I am whistled back from the distance,
I crawl out among stones. Here and now." (Tomas Tranströmer) Later, only an aftertaste, the shuffling of images.
Why try to capture - so stubbornly - the vastness of landscapes in the measure of a few inches, in the curve of your palm?

2nd image:
we used to dream of blue green seas. At early morning we would gaze hard at the distance trying to catch a hint of cobalt in the muddy - and to our young eyes, utterly ordinary -  hues of Bay of Bengal. The lure of blue was the pull of distance. Here everything was dusty and warm, even the sea. Elsewhere - the places glimpsed on TV, cinema and National Geographic magazine - the waters blue or green. "The world is blue at its edges and in its depths. This blue is the light that got lost. Light at the blue end of the spectrum does not travel the whole distance from the sun to us. It disperses among the molecules of the air, it scatters in water." (Rebecca Solnit). 

Images from Heima (at home) by Sigur Rós will open the series. 

Poem by Tomas Tranströmer:

I am whistled back from the distance,
I crawl out among stones. Here and now.

Mission: to be where I am
Also, in my silly and solemn role,
I am the place
where creation worked on iteself.

postscript:

Instagram as a home for images? A place inhabited by so many places, often monumental landscapes. The alps or himalayas encapsulated in the rectangle of a smartphone screen. Inch high himalayas (Shahid Ali) not in postcard but smartphone. Don't lapse into the rope of virtual space - cyberspace. Concentrate on the materiality of the cellular phone's screen. Of the screen in the palm of our hand. The window into the view.
