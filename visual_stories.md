The seal glided down effortlessly and held her gaze, just for a moment. But that would come afterwards, if at all. 
Berger - in Why Look at Animals -  writes: "By no other species except man will the animal's look be recognised as familiar. Other animals are held by the look. Man becomes aware of himself returning the look." 
Weronisia stongly feels that everyone should be afraid of crocodiles. Everyone, excpet her. She adoers them. Weronisia is three. She has a stuffed toy crockodile. In some of her books, or puzzles there are images of the animal whose photographic likeness she hasen't yet seen. She actually knows a lot about her favorite animal and loves it dearly despite (or perhaps because of) its fierce reputation. 


Caption for an unseen image:
Teju Cole in facebook as caption for a photo from Venice:
"John said he'd stopped taking pictures sometime in the 1980s because (my words now, as I forget exactly what he said) the kind of looking you do for a photograph forecloses other kinds of seeing. What he has photographed he has a hard time writing about. So he stops taking photographs."

My rambling now: It was in this street (in Bergamo) the first morning that I realized, 3 rolls of film already spent, that I have been seeing solely through the viewfinder's window. The camera has become an indispensable organ, not only of seeing, but of being present. 

I knew a photographer who would go to obscure villages looking for images. He would be the most active at early morning, as the day grew longer he would become irritated; towards evening he would click maniacally. As the sun set he would loose all interest in the place, retreat to the guest house or hotel and count the hours till he would fall asleep.





BLUE: "Blue says outrageously and absurdly I'm yours or you'r mine and no other can judge us."  John Berger.




2006, 
"Having toured the world over, Sigur Ros returned home to play a series of free, unannounced concerts in Iceland." Heima in Icelandic means "at home". 
Being grounded in Warsaw I put on Heima one freezing January evening. A boundless landscape held within seventeen inch. The layered music spill over from closed back headphones. Presence takes gentle effort. When it takes place, the window vanishes. Being transported. Yes, that's what happens at those odd moments. Until it ends. "I am whistled back from the distance,
I crawl out among stones. Here and now." (Tomas Tranströmer) Later, only an aftertaste, the shuffling of images.
Why try to capture - so stubbornly - the vastness of landscapes in the measure of a few inches, in the curve of your palm?

2nd image:
We used to dream of blue green seas. At early morning we would gaze hard at the distance trying to catch a hint of cobalt in the muddy - and to our impatient eyes, utterly ordinary -  hues of Bay of Bengal. The lure of blue was the pull of distance. Here everything was dusty and warm, even the sea. Elsewhere - the places glimpsed on cinema, TV, books and National Geographic magazine - the waters blue or green. "The world is blue at its edges and in its depths. This blue is the light that got lost. Light at the blue end of the spectrum does not travel the whole distance from the sun to us. It disperses among the molecules of the air, it scatters in water." (Rebecca Solnit). 

Image 3: Blue boat
We pitched camp (illegally) on a grassy slope near the beach. We had the bay to ourselves. 

Listen, the last primary color to be named was blue. 
Ancient Greeks did not have a word for blue.
Neither did Vedic Sanskrit, Hebrew, Chinease.
For Homer, the sea was wine dark, not blue.
Some say words affect the way we see.

Do you see the same blues as I do? Write to me...
Puck Bay, Hel Peninsula, Summer 2015

Image 4: Sign posts
I wrote to him: it never gets real dark, even at night. The sky stays faintly blue, as if gently backlit. The signposts announce trails leading onwards, in all directions. 



Image ? (has to be baltic):

The water stays/remains cold, always. When I first saw the Baltic, it was steel grey under a monochrome sky. Sunlight broke through towards afternoon, the transfiguring brightness dare I say felt celestial. Its so fleeting. The light, the warmth. 


here in the northmost sea save one. "I belong" Pawel Huelle writes "to the culture of the north, which is sad, melancholy, nostalgic, bleak; there is not much light - hence several of my characters search for the light, and ultimately disappear into it."

Pawel Huelle: 
I wrote them around the age of fifty, in the realisation that I am a man of the Baltic - all the stories are set in my own native region, Gdansk and the sorrounding coast, except for 'Oland' which is set on a Swedish island, but still in the Baltic Sea. And that means I belong to the culture of the north, which is sad, melancholy, nostalgic, bleak; there is not much light - hence several of my characters search for the light, and ultimately disappear into it. This is the culture of herrings, potatoes and vodka, not wine, and this is the place that has shaped me, like it or not


Images from Heima (at home) by Sigur Rós will open the series. 

Poem by Tomas Tranströmer:

I am whistled back from the distance,
I crawl out among stones. Here and now.

Mission: to be where I am
Also, in my silly and solemn role,
I am the place
where creation worked on iteself.

postscript:

Instagram as a home for images? A place inhabited by so many places, often monumental landscapes. The alps or himalayas encapsulated in the rectangle of a smartphone screen. Inch high himalayas (Shahid Ali) not in postcard but smartphone. Don't lapse into the rope of virtual space - cyberspace. Concentrate on the materiality of the cellular phone's screen. Of the screen in the palm of our hand. The window into the view.
