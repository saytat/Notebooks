In the summer of 2006 Sigur Ros returned from World Tour to Iceland, to play free improptu gigs at far flung places. Heima in Icelanding means at home. Being grounded in Warsaw, on a freezing January evening I immerse myself in / put on Sigur Ros's Heima/that film. A boundless landscape encompassed in 17in screen. The layered music spill over from closed back headphones. Presence takes effort. When it takes place, the window vanishes. Being trasported. Yes, that's what happens at those odd moments. Untill it ends. "I am whistled back from the distance,
I crawl out among stones. Here and now." Only an aftertaste, the pale geamings of quiet images remain.
Why do we try to capture -so stubornly - the vastness of landscapes in the measure of a few inches?

Images from Heima (at home) by Sigur Rós will open the series. 

Poem by Tomas Tranströmer:

I am whistled back from the distance,
I crawl out among stones. Here and now.

Mission: to be where I am
Also, in my silly and solemn role,
I am the place
where creation worked on iteself.

postscript:

Instagram as a home for images? A place inhabited by so many places, often monumental landscapes. The alps or himalayas encapsulated in the rectangle of a smartphone screen. Inch high himalayas (Shahid Ali) not in postcard but smartphone. Don't lapse into the rope of virtual space - cyberspace. Concentrate on the materiality of the cellular phone's screen. Of the screen in the palm of our hand. The window into the view.
