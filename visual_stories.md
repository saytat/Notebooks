2006, 
Having toured the world over, Sigur Ros returned home to play a series of free, unannounced concerts in Iceland. Heima in Icelanding means "at home". Being grounded in Warsaw, on a freezing January evening I put on Heima. A boundless landscape held within seventeen inchs. The layered music spill over from closed back headphones. Presence takes effort. When it takes place, the window vanishes. Being trasported. Yes, that's what happens at those odd moments. Untill it ends. "I am whistled back from the distance,
I crawl out among stones. Here and now." (Tomas Tranströmer) Later, only an aftertaste, the shuffling of images.
Why try to capture - so stubornly - the vastness of landscapes in the measure of a few inches?


2nd image:
we used to dream of blue green sea. At early morning we would gaze hard at the distance trying to catch a hint of cobalt in the earthly - and to our young eyes, utterly ordinary -  colors of Bay of Bengal. The lure of blue was the pull of distance. Here, everything was dusty and warm, even the sea. Elsewhere - the places glimpsed on TV, cinema and National Geographic magazine - the waters blue or green. (Like her eyes, from the name of a fat classic - a pair of blue eyes. My best friend spend his pocket money in buying the thick tome of Anna Karenina. Why did you buy this book? Because of the image on its cover.)  

Images from Heima (at home) by Sigur Rós will open the series. 

Poem by Tomas Tranströmer:

I am whistled back from the distance,
I crawl out among stones. Here and now.

Mission: to be where I am
Also, in my silly and solemn role,
I am the place
where creation worked on iteself.

postscript:

Instagram as a home for images? A place inhabited by so many places, often monumental landscapes. The alps or himalayas encapsulated in the rectangle of a smartphone screen. Inch high himalayas (Shahid Ali) not in postcard but smartphone. Don't lapse into the rope of virtual space - cyberspace. Concentrate on the materiality of the cellular phone's screen. Of the screen in the palm of our hand. The window into the view.
