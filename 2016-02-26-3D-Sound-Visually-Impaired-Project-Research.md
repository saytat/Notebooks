## A New Post

My topic: 3D sound applications for visually imapiered people.
New Idea: Games/Toys for visually impaired children, pre-teens, teens. Games for learning programming. A scratch for visually impaired children. Or sound design tool kits for them. This will be beyond my research area, still need to check out the field.

1. Idea#1: 3D audio simulation of real environment for training recently blind people, children inside room/closed environment. Or for training trainers of blind people. The training can be very important for people going progressively blind. In such cases the open street can be dangerous. 3D audio simulation of open space - street can be used as training material in indoor spaces.
2. for blind children: audio based education app. teaching mathematcis via music. physics via sound interaction design.
3. Soundwalk for visually imapired people. Outdoor soundwalk. Indoor soundwalk with iBeacons technology.
4. Teaching music with haptic devices to children?
5. Sound providing information about scientific experiments? Example: geiger counter.
6. For people with low to very low eyesight, can there be any visual augmentation via google glass kind of smart eye wear? Or think of aural navigation / storytelling for low eyesight people.
7. Subset of soundwalk for visually impaired people: nature walks in and around Warsaw. Since the topology is plains, it can be helpful for blind people to go for walks. Also think of a audio app/device that can magnify real sound in 3D so that people with visual and slight aural impairement can also use it.
8. Think of bone conducting audio (cities unlimited project) for deaf and dumb?
9. The project can be built around developing an open source app i.e. platform independent app for use with the cities unlimited project hardware.
10. Biking for visually impaired children. What digital tool can be useful?
11. Biking for deaf person. Smart glasses? Bone conduicting audio signals?
12. If guide sticks are enhanced with sensor that can amplify sound or provide sound signals to the blind. Smart walker.
13. What areas of work are visually impaired people often employed in outside the domain of office work in developed societies. What non office work can visually impaired people do in India? What tools are available?

Sound broadcast via beacons technology: if cafes, medicine shops etc can be equiped with beacons technology that can push notifications to mobile phones. 
Special case use. Push notifications in 3D audio to boneconducting headphones.
