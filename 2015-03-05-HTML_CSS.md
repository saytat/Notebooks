HTML5 Notes:

* __main__ element: 

	1.[Use Case from W3C](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/User:Sfaulkne/main-usecases) 

* __semantic tags vs div__:
[Argument in favor of using semantic tags](https://adactio.com/journal/4999)
	>The specific example of divs and sectioning content is troublesome though. There is a difference between a div and a section or article (or aside or nav). I donâ€™t just mean the semantic difference (a div conveys no meaning about the contained content whereas a section element is specifically for enclosing thematically-related content). There are also practical differences.

	>A section element will have an effect on the generated outline for a document (a div will not). The new outline algorithm in HTML5 will make life a lot easier for future assistive technology and searchbots (as other people mentioned in the comments) but it already has practical effects today in some browsers in their default styling.

* __html tags that has impact on DOM__:
[To make things even simpler, only two things in your mark-up affect the outline of a Web page:](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/16/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/)
heading content (h1 to h6 and hgroup),
sectioning content (section, article, aside and nav).

An outline created with heading content this way is said to consist of implicit, or implied, sections. Each heading creates its own implicit section, and any subsequent heading of a lower level starts another layer, of implicit sub-section, within it.
