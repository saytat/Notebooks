HTML5 Notes:

**main** element:

**semantic tags vs div**:
[Argument in favor of using semantic tags](https://adactio.com/journal/4999)

The specific example of divs and sectioning content is troublesome though. There is a difference between a div and a section or article (or aside or nav). I donâ€™t just mean the semantic difference (a div conveys no meaning about the contained content whereas a section element is specifically for enclosing thematically-related content). There are also practical differences.

A section element will have an effect on the generated outline for a document (a div will not). The new outline algorithm in HTML5 will make life a lot easier for future assistive technology and searchbots (as other people mentioned in the comments) but it already has practical effects today in some browsers in their default styling.
