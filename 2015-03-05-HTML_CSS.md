HTML5 Notes:

* __main__ element: 

	1.[Use Case from W3C](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/User:Sfaulkne/main-usecases) 

* __semantic tags vs div__:
[Argument in favor of using semantic tags](https://adactio.com/journal/4999)
	>The specific example of divs and sectioning content is troublesome though. There is a difference between a div and a section or article (or aside or nav). I don’t just mean the semantic difference (a div conveys no meaning about the contained content whereas a section element is specifically for enclosing thematically-related content). There are also practical differences.

	>A section element will have an effect on the generated outline for a document (a div will not). The new outline algorithm in HTML5 will make life a lot easier for future assistive technology and searchbots (as other people mentioned in the comments) but it already has practical effects today in some browsers in their default styling.

* __html tags that has impact on DOM__:
[To make things even simpler, only two things in your mark-up affect the outline of a Web page:](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/16/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/)
heading content (h1 to h6 and hgroup),
sectioning content (section, article, aside and nav).

* __implicit and explicit sections__:

An outline created with heading content this way is said to consist of implicit, or implied, sections. Each heading creates its own implicit section, and any subsequent heading of a lower level starts another layer, of implicit sub-section, within it. *An implicit section is ended by a heading of the same level or higher*.

* __sectioning root__:

The body element is not the only one that acts as sectioning root. There are five others:

* blockquote
* details
* fieldset
* figure
* td

The status of these elements as sectioning root has two implications. First, each can have its own outline. Secondly, the outline of nested sectioning root does not appear in, nor does it have an effect on, the outline of its parent sectioning root.
In practice, this means that headings inside any of the five sectioning root elements listed above do not affect the outline of the document that they are a part of.
The final thing (you’ll be glad to hear) that I’ll say about sectioning root is that the first heading in the document that is not inside sectioning content is considered to be the document title.
