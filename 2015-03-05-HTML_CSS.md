HTML5 Notes:

* __main__ element: 

	1.[Use Case from W3C](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/User:Sfaulkne/main-usecases) 

* __semantic tags vs div__:
[Argument in favor of using semantic tags](https://adactio.com/journal/4999)

* __html tags that has impact on DOM__:
[To make things even simpler, only two things in your mark-up affect the outline of a Web page:](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/16/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/)
heading content (h1 to h6 and hgroup),
sectioning content (section, article, aside and nav).

	>The specific example of divs and sectioning content is troublesome though. There is a difference between a div and a section or article (or aside or nav). I donâ€™t just mean the semantic difference (a div conveys no meaning about the contained content whereas a section element is specifically for enclosing thematically-related content). There are also practical differences.

	>A section element will have an effect on the generated outline for a document (a div will not). The new outline algorithm in HTML5 will make life a lot easier for future assistive technology and searchbots (as other people mentioned in the comments) but it already has practical effects today in some browsers in their default styling.
